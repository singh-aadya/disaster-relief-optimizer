## üî¨ Algorithm Implementation

### Priority Calculation
```java
Priority = (Urgency √ó 0.5) + (Family_Size √ó 0.3) + (1/Distance √ó 0.2)
```

### Greedy Sorting
- Families sorted by priority score (descending)
- Active families processed first
- Stable sort for equal priorities

### Modified 0/1 Knapsack
- Family-specific capacity calculation
- Supply optimization by value-to-weight ratio
- Priority allocation for high-urgency cases
- Optimal unit calculation per supply type

## üìä Features Implemented

### Data Management
- Family registration with validation
- Inventory management with capacity tracking
- Dynamic status updates (active/inactive)
- Bulk data import with sample scenarios

### Allocation Engine
- Priority-based family sorting
- Constraint-aware supply allocation
- Emergency prioritization (medicine/water first)
- Rebalancing when data changes

### Reporting System
- Detailed allocation summaries
- Family-specific allocation breakdowns
- Inventory status tracking
- ASCII-based supply usage visualization
- CSV export for external analysis

### User Interface
- Interactive console menus
- Input validation and error handling
- Progress feedback during allocation
- Status displays and summaries

## üß™ Testing Coverage

### Test Scenarios
1. **Balanced Scenario**: 10 diverse families, standard inventory
2. **High Demand**: 25 families competing for limited supplies
3. **Emergency**: High-urgency families requiring immediate aid
4. **Custom Testing**: User-defined families and inventory levels

### Edge Cases Handled
- Zero inventory situations
- No active families
- Equal priority conflicts
- Capacity overflow prevention
- Invalid input handling

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
1. Ensure Java JDK 8+ is installed
2. Run `compile_and_run.bat`
